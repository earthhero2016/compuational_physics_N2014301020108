##Problem 2.7
Use the adiabatic model of the air density (2.24) to calculate the cannon shell trajectory, and compare with the results found 
using (2.23). Also, one can further incorpotate the effects of the variation of the ground temperature(seasonal changes) by 
replacing B_2 by B_2^ref(T_0/T_ref)^alpha, where B^ref is the value of B_2 at a reference temperature T_ref and T_0 is the actual 
ground temperature. The value quoted in the text is appropriate for T=300K. In particular, how much effect will the adiabatic model 
have on the maximum range and the launch angle to achive it? How much do they vary from a cold day in winter to a hot summer day?
