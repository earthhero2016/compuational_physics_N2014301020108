##Abstract
This article mainly discusses orbits of planets and precession of the perihelion of Mercury by using Euler-Cromer method, and motion equation of planets. In addition, solutions of exercise 4.8,4.9, and 4.10 are included, all done by python and Vpython programs.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/Orbits%20solar%20system.py)

However, when the kinetic energy of the planet is large enough, its trajectory can be parabola or hyperbola.
