##Abstract
This article mainly discusses orbits of planets and precession of the perihelion of Mercury by using Euler-Cromer method, and motion equation of planets. In addition, solutions of exercise 4.8,4.9, and 4.10 are included, all done by python and Vpython programs.

However, when the kinetic energy of the planet is large enough, its trajectory can be parabola or hyperbola.

##Solution
###Exercise 4.8 Kepler's third law.
The Kepler's third law is that T^2/a^3 =constant, where T is the period of the planet and a is its major semi-axis. In the solar system, this constant is about 1 (yr^2/AU^3). Here, I imagine three planets in the solar system and plot their trajectories and calculate their periods to verify the Kepler's third law. The initialized parameter is Mp,e,a. For these three imaginary planets, these values are respectively, 7,0.1,3;60,0.05,13;200,0.5,25.
