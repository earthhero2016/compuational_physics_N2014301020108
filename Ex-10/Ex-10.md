##Abstract
This article mainly discusses orbits of planets and precession of the perihelion of Mercury by using Euler-Cromer method, and motion equation of planets. In addition, solutions of exercise 4.8,4.9, and 4.10 are included, all done by python and Vpython programs.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/Orbits%20solar%20system.py)

However, when the kinetic energy of the planet is large enough, its trajectory can be parabola or hyperbola.

##Solution
###Exercise 4.8 Kepler's third law.
The Kepler's third law is that T^2/a^3 =constant, where T is the period of the planet and a is its major semi-axis. In the solar system, this constant is about 1 (yr^2/AU^3). Here, I imagine three planets in the solar system and plot their trajectories and calculate their periods to verify the Kepler's third law. The initialized parameter is Mp,e,a. For these three imaginary planets, these values are respectively, 7,0.1,3; 60,0.05,13; 200,0.5,25.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/4.81.py)

Output

The values of T^2/a^3 are respectively 0.99998, 0.99997, 0.99990. From this, we can say the Kepler's third law is workable, at least in the solar system.

So, let's us move to a different stellar system to investigate whether the constant changes or not. The mass of the new "sun" is 100 times smaller than our sun. And the values of  Mp,e,a are the same as those of the above imaginary planets.

Output

The values of T^2/a^3 are 9.9955, 9.9700,and 9.9009 respectively. So the constant in the third law is different in different stellar system. 
###Exercise 4.10 Deviation from an inverse-squre dependence

First, we select some initial conditions of two planet to make one of their trajectory is circular and the other one is ellipse when beta=2

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/4.9.py)

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/beta%3D2.png)

Then, we change the value of beta to be 2.05,2.2,2.5.

Output

Vpython Animation

When beta=2.05

When beta=2.2

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/beta%3D2.2.gif)

When beta=2.5

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-10/beta%3D2.5n.gif)

From these figures, we find that circular orbit when beta=2 is stable even beta changes while ellipse orbits are unstable.
