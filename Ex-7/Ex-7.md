##Abstract
This article mainly discusses chaos in thee driven nonlinear pendulum and involves the solutions of exercise 3.12,3.13,3.14.The crucial method used in the article is Euler_Cromer method.

First, we investigate the behaviours of \theta for F_D=0.5 and F_D=1.2 with the same other parameters.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-7/theta.py)
Output

From this, we see that the pendulum eventually oscillates with the driven force when F_D=0.5,however, when F_D is 1.2, the behaviour of the pendulum becomes unpredictable, namely, is in chaos.

Then, we plot the angular velocity versus time and the angular velocity versus \theta.
