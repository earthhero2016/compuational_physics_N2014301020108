##Abstract
This article mainly discusses the billiard problem, one of the chaotic problem, and use programs to plot the trajectories of the billiard and phase space. In addition, solutions of exercise 3.30 and 3.31 are included.
##Background

When the boundary is a unit circle, the trajectories of the ball are shown by the following pictures.

The initial conditions are different in the two figures. Now, we plot the Phase-spaces of the two balls above, which can be constructed by plotting x-vx figures only when y=0.
