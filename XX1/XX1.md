##胡塾绪 2014301020108
##Abstract
This article mainly discusses the phase transitions of ferromagnetism illustrated by the 2D-Ising model by using mean potential theory and Monte Carlo method.The variation of magnetization with temperature and magnetic field is demostrated dominantly.
##Background
###Ferromagnetism
Ferromagnetism discribes the spontaneous magnetization of some materials,that is, a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field. As the temperature increases, thermal motion, or entropy, competes with the ferromagnetic tendency. When the temperature rises beyond a certain point, called the Curie temperature, there is a second-order **phase transition** and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization.
