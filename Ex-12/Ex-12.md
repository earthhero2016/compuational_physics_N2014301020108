##Abstract 
This article mainly discusses the electric potentials and fields and solves Laplace's equantion by using Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods. Plus, the solutions of Exercise 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.8 are included.

##Solution
###Exercise 5.1 Prism
There is an infinitely long, hollow prism, with metallic walls and a square cross-section. Inside this prism is a metal bar, also with a square cross-section. The inner conductor is held at V=1 and the walls of the prism at V=0. We using Jacobi method to plot its Voltage distribution, equipotential lines and electric field.
