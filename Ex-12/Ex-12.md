##Abstract 
This article mainly discusses the electric potentials and fields and solves Laplace's equantion by using Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods. Plus, the solutions of Exercise 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.8 are included.
##Background

##Solution
###Exercise 5.1 Prism
There is an infinitely long, hollow prism, with metallic walls and a square cross-section. Inside this prism is a metal bar, also with a square cross-section. The inner conductor is held at V=1 and the walls of the prism at V=0. We using Jacobi method to plot its Voltage distribution, equipotential lines and electric field.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/5.1.py)

Delta V is 0.4 since there are 400 grid elements.
##Exercise 5.3 Capacitor

Again, we use the Jacobi method to solve the capacitor problem.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/Capacitor.py)

Output

###Exercise 5.5 
Now, we use Gauss-Seidel method and SOR method to solve the capacitor problem and investigate the convergence velocity of three different methods. The number of iterations of Jacobi method is 2890 when Delta V is 0.4. Modifying the above code, we obtain that the number if iterations is 2735 and 2062 for Gauss-Seidel method and SOR method respectively. Thus, the SOR method can highly raise the convergence velocity.
###Exercise 5.6 Lighting rod
The rod is very long and narrow with a high voltage, with one end near a conducting plane. Imagining that the rod is in the x-y plane, we investigate the voltage distribution, equipotential lines and electric field.

###Exercise 5.8 Point charge
A point charge locates at the center of the metal box. The faces of the box are all held at V=0. Using SOR method, we investigate its behaviors of fields and potentials.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/point%20charge.py)

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/charge.png)

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/charge%20C.png)

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-12/charge%20E%20true.png)

Now, we move the point charge off center. Let's see what will change.

###Conclusion
Instead of Solving the Laplace's equation directly, we use relaxtion method, which is checked to be workable by our programming. There are three different methods, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR method. The SOR method is most effective.
