##Abstract
This article mainly discusses the chaotic tumbling of hyperion, one of the smaller moons of Saturn and includes the solutions of Exercise 4.19 and 4.20. In addition, the three body problem is also shown by this article.
##Background
###Three body

If there are double stars and one planet, the orbits of the planet will be chaotic as the animation shows. We explore this problem by increasing the mass of Jupiter and investigating the behavior of earth.

As the mass of Jupiter increases, the orbit of earth becomes more chaotic.
###Hyperion

The phase space plot is shown by the following picture.

From these pictures, we find that the motion of Hyperion is chaotic when the orbit is elliptical.

###Solution
####Exercise 4.19 Lyapunov exponent
Here, we investigate the divergence of two nearby trajectories of  the tumbling motion of Hyperion. We plot the difference between two calculated results for theta(t) with different initial conditions. We use theta(0)=0 for one trajectory and theta(0)=0.01 for the other.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-11/4.19.py)

We operate this for different orbits of the mass center with initial velocity 3,4,5,6 HU/yr.

When v_i=3HU/yr

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-11/3%20%204.1.png)

the Lyapunov exponent is about 4.1

When v_i=4HU/yr,

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-11/4%203.8.png)

the Lyapunov exponent is about 3.8

When v_i=5HU/yr,

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-11/5%200.6.png)

the Lyapunov exponent is about 0.6

When v_i=6HU/yr,

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-11/6%200.05.png)

the Lyapunov exponent is about 0.05.

From these pictures, we find that as the initial velocity increases, the orbits of Hyperion becomes less elliptical and the Lyapunov exponent decreases.
####Exercise 4.20
We saw that the figures of 4.19 have some jumps. This is because the restriction that -pi< theta < pi. If we remove this restriction, the jumps will disappear.

The dips is caused by the turning point effect.When one's angular velocity closes to 0, the other system is still rotating so that the divergence of theta will vary extremely.
##Conclusion
We write some programs to show some chaotic phenomena in astronomy. One is three body problem;the other one is the tumbling of Hyperion.
