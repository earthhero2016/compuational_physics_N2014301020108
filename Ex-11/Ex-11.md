##Abstract
This article mainly discusses the chaotic tumbling of hyperion, one of the smaller moons of Saturn and includes the solutions of Exercise 4.19 and 4.20. In addition, the three body problem is also shown by this article.
##Background
###Three body

If there are double stars and one planet, the orbits of the planet will be chaotic as the animation shows. We explore this problem by increasing the mass of Jupiter and investigating the behavior of earth.

As the mass of Jupiter increases, the orbit of earth becomes more chaotic.
