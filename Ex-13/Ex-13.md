##Abstract
This article mainly discusses problems of wave motion and use programs to solve the wave function with different initialized conditions. Typically, the initial conditions are 'Gaussian pluck'.Plus, we also show the spectrum of the oscillation of a fixed point by doing Flouier Transformation.
