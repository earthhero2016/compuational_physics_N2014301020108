##Abstract
This article mainly discusses problems of wave motion and use programs to solve the wave function with different initialized conditions. Typically, the initial conditions are 'Gaussian pluck'.Plus, we also show the spectrum of the oscillation of a fixed point by doing Flouier Transformation.
##Background

First, I make an animation of the motion of string with a Gaussian excitation at the midpoint. The two ends of the string are fixed.

Then, to do a spectrum analysis, the displacement of a distance 5 percent from one end was recorded. Additionly, doing a Flouier Transformation, we obtained the following results.

The dotted curve is the power spectrum obtained when the string was excited 5 percent from its center.
##Solution

###Problem 6.9 Free end
In this case, the right end of the string is free while the left one is held fixed.The Gaussian wavepacket located at center.

The displacement a distance 5 percent from the left end and its spectrum are shown by the following picture.

For comparison, we plot this spectrum and the spectrum with two fixed ends in one figure.

The dotted curve is the spectrum with fixed ends. From the picture, we can see that the peaks with one free end is more than the peaks with fixed end. This is because one free end allows more oscillatory nodes. Besides, it should be noticed that the new spectrum doesn't include the former peaks because the unfixed end reduces the oscillatory nodes corresponding to two fixed ends.
###6.12 Realistic string
Gaussian initial string displacements are not very realistic. When a real string, such as a guitar string, is plucked, the initial string displacement is like a triangle. So, we do the same analysis to this case and compare its spectrum with Gaussian pluck.

When the top point is at center,

Comparison with Gaussian pluck

The realistic excitation allows less peaks than the Gaussian pluck.

Now, we change the initial pluck by moving the top point of the triangle off the center of the string at the distance 20 percent from one end.

Comparison with the last case

This initial pluck induces more peaks
###6.13 Different observation position
Now, we investigate the spectrum of different observation points x0, which are 10 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent from the end of the string. The initial Gaussian excitation located at the center of the string.

Result

Obvious, the oscillatory nodes are different from each other. However, the 50 percent spectrum has more and even peaks.

Then, we change the position of initial excitation, 10 percent and 40 percent, for instance.

Excitation at 10 percent

Excitation at 40 percent

![](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-13/40.png)

According to all these pictures, it seems like the closer the observatory point to the excitation position, the more nodes will be induced.
###Conclusion
By doing these exercises, we find a numerical way to investigate the wave motion problem by rewriting the wave motion equation. In addition, the Flouier analysis is an effective method to explore the oscillatory nodes of the point on a wave.
