##Abstract
This article mainly discusses problems of wave motion and use programs to solve the wave function with different initialized conditions. Typically, the initial conditions are 'Gaussian pluck'.Plus, we also show the spectrum of the oscillation of a fixed point by doing Flouier Transformation.
##Background

First, I make an animation of the motion of string with a Gaussian excitation at the midpoint. The two ends of the string are fixed.

Then, to do a spectrum analysis, the displacement of a distance 5 percent from one end was recorded. Additionly, doing a Flouier Transformation, we obtained the following results.

The dotted curve is the power spectrum obtained when the string was excited 5 percent from its center.
##Solution
[Code for animation](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-13/6.0.py)

[Code for spectrum](https://github.com/earthhero2016/compuational_physics_N2014301020108/blob/master/Ex-13/6.1.py)
###Problem 6.9 Free end
In this case, one end of the string is free while the other one is held fixed.The Gaussian wavepacket located at center.
