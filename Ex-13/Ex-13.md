##Abstract
This article mainly discusses problems of wave motion and use programs to solve the wave function with different initialized conditions. Typically, the initial conditions are 'Gaussian pluck'.Plus, we also show the spectrum of the oscillation of a fixed point by doing Flouier Transformation.

First, I make an animation of the motion of string with a Gaussian excitation at the midpoint. The two ends of the string are fixed.

Then, to do a spectrum analysis, the displacement of a distance 5 percent from one end was recorded. Additionly, doing a Flouier Transformation, we obtained the following results.
